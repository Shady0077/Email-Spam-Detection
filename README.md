Email Spam Detection: Machine Learning Classification
Overview
This project demonstrates how to classify email messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build models that can accurately identify spam emails based on their textual content. Several classification algorithms are used, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF).

Features
Data Exploration: The dataset is analyzed for basic statistics and visualized for insights into email length distribution and label distribution.
Text Vectorization: The email text is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization to prepare it for model training.
Model Training: Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated. Hyperparameters are tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using confusion matrices, and cross-validation scores are calculated for better generalization.
Outlier Detection: Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is used as an anomaly detection method to identify potential outliers in the data.
Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:

label: Indicates whether an email is spam (1) or ham (0).
text: The content of the email.
Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
scikit-learn
xgboost
You can install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn xgboost
How to Use
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and cleaned by selecting only relevant columns and encoding the labels.
Text Vectorization: The email text is transformed using the TfidfVectorizer to convert text into numerical features.
Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning: Several models are trained, and hyperparameters are tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize each model's performance.
Evaluation: After training the models, their performance is evaluated using confusion matrices and cross-validation scores.
Results
Each model's performance is displayed through confusion matrices, which show how well the model predicted spam vs. ham emails. Additionally, cross-validation scores are calculated to provide an overall performance estimate.

Conclusion
This project provides a foundation for building spam detection systems. The models trained can be further optimized or extended to improve performance or adapt to different datasets. You can experiment with other machine learning algorithms, fine-tune hyperparameters, or deploy the model for real-time spam detection.
